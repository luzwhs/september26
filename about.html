        <p>A coding class this might be interesting. I am sure this is what three students thought when they first started the class. Little did they know that the coding class would bring more realizations to them than just coding. Luz decided to sit towards the back of the room so she could sit and observe without too much interference. She sat right next to Klea and they had an instant connection. Sitting on the same side but all the way in front of the class was Connie. Nothing special so far as the women were concerned.</p>
        
        <p>September 26, 2016 Luz informed the professor that she would be out as it was her birthday and her family was taking her out. She was surprised to find out that there were two other people who shared her birthday in the class. The next class, Luz being the curious Libra that she is, found out that Klea and Connie were her two fellow birthday sharers. The fates would intertwine again when numbers were randomly chosen for a group project. Klea, Connie, and Luz ended up choosing number three. It was then that the three Lovely Libra women knew exactly what their group project would be. Welcome to our <span style="font-weight:bold">September 26th</span> website. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we enjoyed putting it together. </p>

        <p>This Libra has enjoyed astrology, numerology, and anything that has to do with divination, since the 6th grade. I even did my term paper on astrology. I still cannot believe that I ended up sitting next to someone in coding class, born on the same day and year, in the same city. And to have another classmate born on the same day a few seats away from me. How crazy is that?! I have dabbled in stock photography, but am in the process of creating an online tarot blog, and hoping to launch early next year.</p>
        
        <p>My stock photography work can be found on the following websites:</p>
