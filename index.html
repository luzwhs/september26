        <p>Libras are the diplomats of the zodiac. They love peace and harmony, as they are ruled by Venus. On the negative side, they can be indecisive and hold a grudge.</p>

         <h3> Specific September 26th Characteristics.</h3> <!--I cannot get italics to work with <i> so doing inline styling. 11/28 Klea-->
      
        <p>According to <span style="font-style: bolder; color:purple"
        >Michele Bernhardt's</span> <span style="font-style: italic;color:purple;">Colorstrology: What Your Birthday Color Says about You</span>, people born on this day are intense, charismatic, and imaginative. Michele's book features a Pantone Color for each day of the year. Our color is <span style="font-style: bolder; color:purple">Pantone 18-1411 Plum Wine</span>. Use this color for strength, perception and positivity. It is important to not let personal adversity dull our shine. Overcoming hardships only makes us even stronger!</p>
        
        <p>Pantone features a 'color of the day' every day, but do not have an archive to look up past or future dates. You can find the Pantone Color of the Day <a href="https://www.pantone.com/colorstrology" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Numerology for 26 (which breaks down to an 8).</h3>  
        
        <p>People born on the 26th are charismatic and powerful. They are revolutionary thinkers and work very hard, but must be careful to not get caught up in their work. The number 26 can be broken down into an 8, which is a karmic number. Many of the relationships in your life will be karmic and from past lives. </p>
